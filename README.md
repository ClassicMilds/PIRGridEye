# Panasonic PIC24F04KA200 PIRGridEye Driver

This project is divided into 2 parts:

1> A Python driver to work with the sensor. This is written using PySerial. 
We use the USB I2C bridge to connect the PIC24F04KA200  to the computer. The output is displayed using PIL (Python Imaging Library) as RGB. 

2> An Android software that works with the sensor. This is to include a mobile version of this package.
